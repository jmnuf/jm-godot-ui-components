# JM Godot UI Components

A set of UI elements with no true styling set onto them.
This is just a mix of proof of concept ideas and crudely fleshed ideas

## Pill Label
This is just a regular Godot Label with some rather quick access towards a StyleBoxFlat that is used to draw a pill-like shape behind the label's text

## Suggestive Line Edit
This is a LineEdit that has a PopupMenu with suggestions when writing and separates elements with a comma. Originally planned on a TextEdit but failed to get it properly working on a TextEdit, probably just me being confused with the differences in API.
